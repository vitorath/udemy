# React Fundamentals

Create your react application

```console
yarn create-react-app react-fundamentals
```

To make request http install **whatwg-fetch**

```console
yarn add whatwg-fetch
```

The fetch() function is a Promise-based mechanism for programmatically making web requests in the browser. This project is a polyfill that implements a subset of the standard Fetch specification, enough to make fetch a viable replacement for most uses of XMLHttpRequest in traditional web applications.

To manage browser directions

```console
yarn add react-router-dom
```
